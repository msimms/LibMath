# LibMath
A collection of commonly used math routines, in C, C++, Python, and Rust programming languages.

## Rationale
I wanted some small and quick math routines for another project. I've since used them in several projects over the years and now have them here in case anyone else wants to use them instead of a larger, heavyweight math library.

## Using
Add this project as a submodule to your project and then add the files to your build.

## License
This library is released under the MIT license, see LICENSE for details.
